{"name":"Join our Tulalens team!","tagline":"We're looking for a Marketing/Communications Expert and a Developer.","body":"###**About Tulalens**\r\nToday, when upper- and middle- income people have a choice to make, they often turn to Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other sites where they can share and retrieve personal experiences and reviews. This kind of crowdsourced information is powerful: it can improve decision-making and accountability.\r\n\r\n**How can low-income people also benefit from the power of crowdsourced information?** Thatâ€™s the question we asked, and Tulalens is our answer. Tulalens connects the world's under-served communities - people without internet access - to quality health services to improve lives. We're a social enterprise based in Boston. Tula means balanced in Sanskrit. Our name reflects our aim, which is to balance the lens, or create actionable insights by listening to the needs of low-income communities.\r\n\r\n**The opportunity is vast.** Many pregnant women we work with believe they can access only one prenatal care facility near their home. Even when they are treated poorly or forced to pay bribes, they continue going to that facility. By sharing crowdsourced data on fees, quality of the provider, wait time, bribes paid and more, women now have critical information that will allow them to make informed decisions on which of several facilities to attend.  \r\n\r\n**It's time to expand our work.** Since launching in Oct. 2014, we have reached 600 women in need of reproductive health services across three of the largest slum areas in Hyderabad. We're on our way to building a preliminary technology platform that will allow us to scale to other geographies, demographics and services.\r\n\r\nWe're actively looking for people to fill the two roles below: \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n###**Marketing and Communications Expert**\r\nWe're looking for a volunteer with marketing and communications expertise who is eager to work at a fast-paced startup social enterprise, and is willing to volunteer 5 to 10 hours of their time a week from the end of August 2015 through at least May 2016.
