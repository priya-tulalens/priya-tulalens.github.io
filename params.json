{"name":"Tulalens is looking for a developer","tagline":"","body":"### About Tulalens\r\nToday, when upper- and middle- income people have a choice to make, they often turn to Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other sites where they can share and retrieve personal experiences and reviews. This kind of crowdsourced information is powerful: it can improve decision-making and accountability.\r\n\r\nHow can low-income people also benefit from the power of crowdsourced information? That’s the question we asked, and Tulalens is our answer. Tulalens is a system for some of the world’s poorest communities in emerging markets – people without internet access – to share feedback and retrieve crowdsourced information on organizations that provide them with healthcare and other critical needs. Tula means balanced in Sanskrit. Our name reflects our aim, which is to balance the lens, or create actionable insights by listening to the needs of low-income communities.\r\n\r\nWe're a social enterprise based in the Boston area.\r\n\r\n**The results so far are powerful.** In our pilot, 114 pregnant women in an Indian slum used our system, and the following happened within a month:\r\n25% of women switched to a higher quality prenatal care facility\r\n43% advocated for better services at their facility\r\n100% discussed the data with their husbands \r\nThe opportunity is vast. Many pregnant women we work with believe they can access only one prenatal care facility near their home. Even when they are treated poorly or forced to pay bribes, they continue going to that facility. By sharing crowdsourced data on fees, quality of the provider, wait time, bribes paid and more, women now have critical information that will allow them to make informed decisions on which of several facilities to attend.  \r\n\r\n**It's time to expand our work.** Since launching in Oct. 2014, we have reached 600 women in need of reproductive health services across three of the largest slum areas in Hyderabad. In these instances we were collecting and sharing information in person. Now that we've tested the approach, we're ready to build a prototype mobile technology that will allow us to scale. \r\n\r\n### Role\r\nWe're currently looking for a volunteer (location agnostic) who: \r\n\r\n* Wants to help shape a better future for low-income communities\r\n* Will lead the development of our prototype technology\r\n* Will set our technical direction and stack (we're building in Python, but open to changing)\r\n* Can lead and mentor other developers\r\n* Wants to improve the quality of lives of low-income people by tapping into community expertise\r\n* Is ready to tackle tough challenges that may not have apparent technical solutions\r\n* Has worked and/or lived in emerging markets\r\n\r\n**If we come across someone who's an excellent fit, this role has the potential to turn into a full-time CTO / Co-Founder role.**\r\n\r\n### Contact Us\r\nIf you or someone you know is interested in this role, please feel free to reach out to priya@tulalens.org.
